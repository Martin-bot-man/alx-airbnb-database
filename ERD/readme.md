##DATABASE

This database has been designed following Third Normal Form (3NF) principles to ensure data integrity, eliminate redundancy, and maintain consistency across all tables. The database manages a property rental/booking system with users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, and messaging functionality.
Database Schema
The database consists of six main entities:

User - Stores user account information
Property - Contains property listings
Booking - Manages reservation records
Payment - Tracks payment transactions
Review - Stores user reviews for properties
Message - Handles user-to-user communication
